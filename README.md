# Hey! Welcome to my GitHub! I'm [Nicholas Griffin](https://nicholasgriffin.dev)

I'm a Senior Software Engineer who is currently based in London, UK. I write a lot of JavaScript and TypeScript apps, for my public profile, I'll be sharing the odd project that I'm working on, of course, a lot of what I'm working on is private :).

I generally create websites for GitHub projects based around some technology that I'm interested in at the time, however, sometimes, I may also work on tools around creating websites.
